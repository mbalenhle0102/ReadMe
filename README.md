# OS Power User: User & File Management Exercise 💻

This project was completed as part of **Course 3: Operating Systems and You – Becoming a Power User**. It demonstrates proficiency in system administration tasks using the command line interface (CLI), specifically focusing on Windows PowerShell.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **User & Group Management:** Creating local accounts and assigning roles.
* **Security & Permissions:** Managing Access Control Lists (ACLs) for files.
* **Package Management:** Automating software installation via `winget`.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### 1. User and Group Management
I utilized PowerShell to manage system identities without a GUI. This is a critical skill for managing servers and remote environments.
* **Commands used:** `New-LocalUser`, `New-LocalGroup`, `Add-LocalGroupMember`
* **Outcome:** Created a restricted user and assigned them to a specific security group.

### 2. File Systems and Permissions
I demonstrated the principle of **Least Privilege** by manually configuring file access.
* **Commands used:** `New-Item`, `Get-Acl`, `Set-Acl`
* **Outcome:** Created a secure file and granted "Read" access to a specific user using an Access Control Rule.

### 3. Package Management
Rather than manually downloading installers, I used a CLI package manager to ensure a secure and repeatable installation process.
* **Commands used:** `winget search`, `winget install`
* **Outcome:** Successfully installed **Notepad++** via the Windows Package Manager.
